# Revision quiz

This is a quiz program to use for my revision, it asks a series of
questions in a random order and records your score. You can choose to
study a single or multiple subjects, or even add your own subjects and
questions.

## Where do I find the program?

There are 3 versions of the program written in python, c and go. To
find each version of the program go to the named directory.

## Why are there 3 versions?

The 3 versions are in 3 different languages: python, c and go.
The program was originally written in python, but then I tried to port
it over to c, since I thought that a compiled program would be easier
to distribute.  However, my attempts to do this were unsuccessful and
so I tried to write it in go. This is what I am currently working on.

## Which version should I use?

Currently, the python version is the most complete. However, I hope to
soon have the go version completed so that I can distribute it as an
executable file.

## What is the future for this project?

Currently I am porting the project over to go. Once that is finished,
I am hoping to have the project read the questions in from a yaml or
json file to add for easy customisability of questions. Lastly, I would
then find out how best to package up and distribute the program for
Windows and Linux users.
